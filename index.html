    <h2>Chicano Park Herb Garden</h2>
    <p>The Chicano Park Herb Garden is a collective community herbal garden for healing, restoring, learning, working and playing. Firmly rooted in the park's history, the garden is a testament to the vision and resolve of the Barrio Logan community. Established in 2015, the garden is the realization of a need to create safe, healthy, and open spaces for local families and visitors alike. Environmental Health Coalition (EHC), a non-profit organization fighting social and environmental justice in the region's low-income communities of color for more than 39 years, had been listening to community request for such a garden space in the park. The land parcel for the garden project is located next to the cactus garden adjacent to 'Return of Quetzalcoatl' mural. An active group of volunteers ranging from Barrio Logan community members, local business owners, area organizations, college/universities, and local K-12 schools, to people just walking by and lending a hand, maintain the Chicano Park Herb Garden. While EHC serves as a co-sponsor and coordinator of the space, the CPSC oversee all aspects of the park.</p>
    <img src="images/LatinoOutdoorsHerbGarden_web.jpg" alt="LatinoOutdoorsHerbGarden_web">
    <p>During the spring and summer, EHC coordinates free public events at the garden so community members can learn about gardening, soil amending, green spaces, and how building open spaces like the herb garden connects community members to each other, the natural world, and to environmental justice. The Chicano Park Herb Garden is a work in progress, constantly evolving in the hands of dedicated caretakers such as Jiapsi Gomez and the Gohlke family. A new mural project is currently underway, and if approved, will be the biggest in the park. This new mural's title, "Haawka: May the Fire in Your Heart Burn Bright" -- is a traditional Kumeyaay greeting. It represents the history of the Kumyaay, indigenous people of Southern and Baja California. True to the vision behind the Chicano Park Herb Garden, the mural presents visitors with an invitation to experience the community garden and live life in harmony with nature. EHC looks forward to sharing the mural with the community. Jorge Gonzalez is the Barrio Logan Organizer with EHC. If you are interested in volunteering or a group visit, please email him at <a href="mailto:JorgeG@environmentalhealth.org">JorgeG@environmentalhealth.org</a></p>

    <h2>Chicano Park approved for National Historic Landmark status</h2>
    <p>U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced the designation of 24 new National Historic Landmarks on January 11, 2017 (December 23, 2016 officially approved). Chicano Park is among those sites. "On April 22, 1970, community residents occupied Chicano Park in San Diego, California, in an ultimately successful effort to prevent the construction of a California Highway Patrol substation on land where the City of San Diego had promised the neighborhood a community park. Representative of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Chicano Park has become a cultural and recreational gathering place for the Chicano community and is the location of the Chicano Park Monumental Murals, an exceptional assemblage of master mural artwork painted on the freeway bridge supports." Read complete press release <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-24-new-national-historic-landmarks">here</a>. Chicano Park has been listed on the California Register of Historical Resources since 1997 and was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 2013. </p>

    <p>NEA National Heritage Fellowships Concert was held on September 27 at Lisner Auditorium, George Washington University and the awards ceremony on September 25! For those of us not in Washington DC this week, the NEA streamed the concert live on its website:<a href="https://www.arts.gov/">art.gov</a>  </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Chicano Park was founded on April 22, 1970 when the community of Logan Heights and Chicano movement activists joined forces to protest the construction of a California Highway Patrol station on the present site of the park. The CHP office was at the time the final insult to a community that had already been degraded by the demolition of hundreds of homes to make way for Interstate 5, the construction of the Coronado Bridge, the placement of toxic industries & junkyards, lack of community facilities, proper schools, jobs, social or medical services.</p>
    <p>Protesters led by the Brown Berets, community activists, artists, M.E.Ch.A. and others took over the site and faced police and bulldozers for days while negotiations took place that resulted in the land being given over for a community park. In the following days and months similar actions by the same groups led to the forming of a Chicano Free Clinic, now known as the Logan Heights Family Health Center, and the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park.</p>
    <p>The struggle for Chicano Park came to symbolize the Chicano Mexicano people's struggle for self-determination and self-empowerment. The murals in the park painted by Chicano artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Ochoa">Victor Ochoa</a>, <a href="https://mariotorero.art/about/">Mario Torero</a> ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_L%C3%B3pez">Yolanda Lopez</a> ,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Montoya">José Montoya</a> , Sal Barajas, Juanishi Orosco, Berenice Badillo, Carmen Linares and many others portray the social, political and cultural issues that form the struggle for the liberation of Chicano Mexicanos.</p>
    <p>Chicano Park has received international recognition as a major public art site. Since 1980, the Park has been listed    on the Historical Landmarks Registry (San Diego Historical Resources Board), since 1997 on the California Register of      Historical Resources. In addition, Chicano Park was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places on     January 23, 2013, and was recently designated a National Historic Landmark on December 23, 2016.</p>
    <p>Every year the community of Barrio Logan, the greater community of San Diego and people throughout the Southwest and across the US come together to celebrate the takeover of Chicano Park.</p>
